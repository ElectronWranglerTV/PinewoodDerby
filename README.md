# PinewoodDerby
A simple utility I wrote in a pinch to time Boy Scout pinewood derby races.
Requires Chrome browser and the electronic timing hardware used in pinewood derby races.
Uses serial port via browser routines I found online (dont remember where), and adds to them.
Also has unfinished/unimplemented features. I had a short time to get things working, and the basic system worked great so there was no reason to go back to finish the extra features.
